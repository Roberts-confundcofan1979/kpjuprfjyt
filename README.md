Wow, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Drop, and I gotta say, what even was that? 😂 Like seriously, they threw you into the middle of everything and expected you to keep up without a map or anything. I feel like my brain did a workout I didn’t sign up for. You know what I mean?

The characters, oh my god, don’t even get me started. They all felt like they had just come from some other   entirely, you know? And like, are we supposed to root for anyone? They’re all kind of a mess, but in a good way? I don’t know, maybe I’m just tired, lol. One minute I’m kind of annoyed, and the next, I’m like, I see you, because relatable chaos is a mood. 😅

>I bet the director was just 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ing and going, “We’ll fix it in post,” and they just never did? Maybe that’s the charm? It’s like 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 a   you know nothing about and just throwing it on. Zero expectations can be fun, right? But then, you're sitting there feeling like you missed a memo. Does that make sense, or am I just rambling here? 😂

Omg, but the cinematography was kinda cool! Some shots just felt like you're right there in the mess of it, and you're thinking, “Is something profound happening right now, or am I just projecting?” Movies that mess with my head like that are such a trip, honestly. But then there are times when I'm like, Can we not? 

And the soundtrack! It's like they pulled every genre from some cosmic hat and were like, Let’s see what happens! Haha, anyway, if you’ve got a 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 night and wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , just go in ready for a ride. Seriously, it’s like having a front-row seat to a very strange rollercoaster. 🎢

int tmp = 0; // what even is this doing here??? 🤷‍♂️

Alright, signing off for now before I start dreaming in strange   dialogues or something. Let me know if you decide to dive into it. I’ll make popcorn and we can virtual-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 again for the full commentary effect. 😂 ttyl!
